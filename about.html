                      My Whole Heart was founded out of love. 
                      Out of love for those around me, love for creativity, and love of expression. 
                      It's so easy to get carried away by the hustle and bustle of daily life. 
                      Between work, responsibilities, and getting enough sleep to not look like you're straight out of the cast of The Walking Dead, it is often so easy to forget to show those around us how much we care.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Weekly dates turn to monthly dates, turn to whenever-we-find-time dates. 
                      Weekly milestones turn to "July, August, September... 4 months. He's 4 months old today". 
                      Daily phone calls turn to "Hi, sorry I missed your last 5 calls". 
                      It's life. But in the heat of the daily grind, sometimes it is important to prioritize those dates. 
                      To look through the photo albums together, to make that phone call. 
                      Sometimes it's good to take a moment to show our loved ones that we care. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      My Whole Heart is about creating and capturing those moments, about loving something with your whole heart and providing a way to express that. 
                      I want to create opportunities for your loved one to open a gift, and for their eyes to light up as they see a gift you put time into planning, for your Christmas tree to represent those sitting around it, for your house to be a walking album to look through together as you reminisce on all the moments worth capturing. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I've watched 2 puppies grow at the speed of light, and have realized it's my anniversary at 11 pm. I wish time could slow down just a little bit to take in all those moments. 
                      And I hope that what I make can provide you with a slight moment where time is frozen, and you get to take it all in.
                  </p>

                        The triple threat: founder of My Whole Heart, Montessori teacher and dog mom.
                        Andrea is the reason My Whole Heart exists.
                        She's a passionate, caring and motivated individual who works incredibly hard to succeed.
                        She also needs to be fed so she doesn't get hangry while working, true story.

                        He is the man on the job helping out wherever and whenever he can, at least when he's not glued to his computer. 
                        Whether or not Heinrich necessarily loves the work <span class="text-decoration-line-through">he volunteered for</span>, his help makes all of this possible.
